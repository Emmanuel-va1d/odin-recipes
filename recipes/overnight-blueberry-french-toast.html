        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare casserole: Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
                Arrange 1/2 of the bread cubes in the dish and top with 
                cream cheese cubes. Sprinkle blueberries over the cream 
                cheese, then top with remaining bread cubes.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and syrup together in a 
                large bowl until well-combined; pour over the bread cubes. 
                Cover and refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>Remove casserole from the refrigerator about 30 minutes 
                before baking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F 
                (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake casserole in the preheated oven, covered, for 30 minutes. 
                Uncover, and continue baking until center is firm and surface 
                is lightly browned, about 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare blueberry sauce: Mix sugar, water, and 
                cornstarch together in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil and 
                cook, stirring constantly, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in blueberries, 
                reduce heat to low, and simmer until all the blueberries burst, 
                about 10 minutes. Stir in butter.</li>
            <li>Serve portions of casserole on plates and pour warm syrup over top.</li>
        </ol>
